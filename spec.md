      - mistyped spells result in corrupted version the spell it's closest too (using leveinstein distance)
      - spells could have grammar?
          - subject + predicate + adverb + object + terminal (spacebar)

  - title: Crone
  - you are red riding hood and a witch
  - you are on your way to grandmas
  - enemies are monsters from the wood

  - boss is wolf
  - secret boss is evil woodsman
- STORY BOARD 4
  - you are a witch
  - your grandchildren play in the dark woods
  - night has fallen but they have not returned

    - if you are overwhelmed (aka die) a hooded figure brings you back to your last savepoint
      - figure is spirit of your late husband, a sorcerer, but player won't find that out till later
    - grunts > minibosses > boss
