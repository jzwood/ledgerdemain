          - `asdf`
          - `c + h + io`
          - `eb, ci, dh`

      - spells consume energy
          - vigor?
          - verve?

      - mistyped spells result in corrupted version the spell it's closest too (using leveinstein distance)
      - spells could have grammar?
          - subject + predicate + adverb + object + terminal (spacebar)
          - action + modifier + enter ?
          - rock + move + quickly = ?
          - maybe adverbs are too complicated?
